Once upon a time...
Once upon a time, in a quiet village nestled between lush green hills, there was a young girl named Elara who dreamed of exploring the world beyond her small home. Every night, she would gaze out her window at the twinkling stars, wondering what lay in the vast lands she could only imagine.

One evening, as she wandered the edge of the forest, she found an old, dusty lantern half-buried in the ground. Intrigued, she picked it up and brushed off the dirt. To her surprise, the lantern glowed softly in her hands. As she rubbed it clean, a warm light poured out, and a gentle voice echoed, “You have found the Lantern of Wishes.

The next morning, with the lantern in her bag and hope in her heart, Elara set off down the winding path, not knowing what adventures awaited her, but ready to embrace them all. 

And so began her journey—a tale of courage, friendship, and discovering the magic within.
